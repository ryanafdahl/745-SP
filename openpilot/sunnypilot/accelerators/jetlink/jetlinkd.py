Provisions whatever large model is selected, then exits.

A download, an upload and a TensorRT build take minutes, so this runs offroad,
and it is the heavy half of jetlink: numpy, the client, tinygrad for the warp.
That is why it is a run and not a daemon. owner.py holds the gadget for the
whole time the link is enabled and starts one of these when something changes;
this borrows the endpoint files from it exactly as modeld does (lending.py), so
the gadget never leaves the bus and a parked car keeps one resident jetlink
process of about 13 MB instead of this one's 47.

Without an owner to borrow from, this opens the gadget itself, as it always
did: a device whose owner died still provisions.

The result is cached on the Jetson, recorded in a param and left loaded on the
server. modeld does its own provisioning over its borrowed link when the picked
model turns out not to be built.

The owner stops this at the onroad transition with SIGTERM, so every long wait
polls `stop`; the server's build thread carries on regardless and modeld picks
the engine up over its own link.

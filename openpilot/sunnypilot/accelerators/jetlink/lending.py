Who may do endpoint IO on the gadget, while one process owns it throughout.

The comma is the USB device: the link exists only while some process holds ep0
with the UDC bound. Two processes used to take turns at that, and every change
of owner was an unplug and a replug as the Jetson saw it, a fresh libusb open
and a fresh server session. jetlinkd holds ep0 for as long as the link is
enabled now, so none of that happens.

What still has to change hands is the right to read the endpoint files.
FunctionFS keeps a queued read queued until something completes it, so a second
reader would sit behind the first and take its reply. This is the handshake for
that: modeld borrows for the length of a drive, jetlinkd stays off the
endpoints while it does, and the connection is the lease, so a modeld that is
killed returns it by dying. There is no "give it back" message: the socket
closing is the only signal, because it is the only one a killed process sends.

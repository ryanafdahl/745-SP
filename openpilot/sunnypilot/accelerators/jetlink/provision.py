Making the Jetson ready to run the model that is picked.

Both owners of the link do this. jetlinkd does it offroad, where it can spend
minutes downloading a gigabyte; modeld's join thread does it onroad, where it
cannot download but can upload a file the comma already has and then wait out
the build with the small model driving. What they share is here: the model's
identity, the upload nobody may make without proving the hash first, the
estimate that turns "build 12%" into a number of minutes, and the record of
what the server ended up with.

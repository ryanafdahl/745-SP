Holding the gadget while the Jetson comes up.

The comma is the USB device: the link exists only while a process holds ep0
with the UDC bound, and every unbind is an unplug the far end has to recover
from. This module is about not doing that, about the single case that still
needs an edge, and about modeld borrowing the endpoints rather than the gadget.
